# Ping Pong Game Assembly

This project is an implementation of a simple Ping Pong game in x86 Assembly language. It utilizes BIOS interrupt calls to manage input/output and game logic.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ping Pong Game! This game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic ping-pong match.

## Game Features

- **Player Controls**: Players can control their paddles using the keyboard.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks scores for both players.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when one player scores a certain number of points.
- **Simple Interface**: The game has a simple text-based interface.

## How to Play

1. **Start Screen**: Upon launching the game, you'll see a start screen with the game title, creator information, and a prompt to start the game.
2. **Game Menu**: Once you start the game, you'll see a menu with instructions on how to play, including player controls and game rules.
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns controlling their paddles using the keyboard. The objective is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle.
4. **Scoring**: Each time a player misses the ball, their opponent scores a point. The game tracks the scores of both players.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when one player reaches a certain score, and the winner is declared.

## How to Run

To run the Ping Pong Game:

1. **Assembly Environment**: Ensure you have an x86 Assembly environment set up.
2. **Preferred IDE**: DOSBox is the preferred IDE for running this game.
3. **Compile**: Compile the source code using an assembler.
4. **Run**: Execute the compiled program.
